ERRORS:
1. Msg 2628, Level 16, State 1, Line 45
String or binary data would be truncated in table 'Training_Institute.dbo.Trainee', column 'gender'. Truncated value: 'F'.
The statement has been terminated.


solution: I set the datatype to check for F OR M, but actual data contained Female and Male, so I changed the
actual data to represent F and M.

2. Msg 547, Level 16, State 0, Line 69
The INSERT statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint "FK__Enrollmen__train__4222D4EF". The conflict occurred in database "Training_Institute", table "dbo.Trainee", column 'trainee_id'.
The statement has been terminated.

solution: The issue was that at the beginning I populated trainee table with wrong data, where trainee id didn't start from 1,2,3,... So when I tried to create enrollment table the foreign key trainee_id had values such 1, 2, 3 which didn't have a reference in trainee table. To solve this I dropped the tables that have trainee_id as foreign key then I dropped Trainee table, and recreated the tables with the correct data. The issue was solved!

3. I got repeated names and emails when I was trying to list trainees info who are under a specific trainer.

Solution: used DISTINCT in SELECT part
